        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="text-justify" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 20px;">
          I have a Bachelor of Laws degree in Business Law from London Metropolitan University, and a Web Development certification from Actualize Coding Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 20px;">
          My expertise lies in manual testing of web and mobile applications across various browsers and platforms, including iOS and Android. I have helped design the QA strategy, written comprehensive test suites, and consistently produced detailed documentation. I have also leveraged tools like ChaiJS in Postman, Python unit tests, Pandas dataframe library, and the Rainforest no-code QA tool to enhance the testing process and ensure the product remains robust.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 20px;">
          In addition, I have acted as the KPR for small projects, ensuring key performance results are met and align with project goals. I use metrics-driven approaches to provide tangible insights into project health and aid in swift decision-making. I have created test data sets, which have bridged QA and Development teams and fostered synergy and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 20px;">
          Furthermore, I have implemented post-deployment strategies, such as smoke and regression testing, and spot-checking, to ensure that the core functionalities remain intact after updates and deliverables meet the predefined quality standards.
